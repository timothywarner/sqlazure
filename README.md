## About

The SQL Server relational database engine has been used by businesses around the world since 1989. Azure SQL Database (originally called SQL Azure) was actually the first product ported to Microsoft Azure in 2010.

Microsoft has had such success with Azure SQL Database that their product team members add new features and functionality first, and then, if the new features are popular enough, will back-port them to SQL Server.

This course gives learners a complete picture of what's possible between SQL Server running locally and Azure SQL Database (as well as its fellow cloud-based family members) in Azure.

### Built With
